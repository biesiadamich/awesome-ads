# Awesome Advertising

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of awesome advertising content, resources and libraries.

**Disclaimer:** I know people really dislike and, sometimes, get angry about ads on sites and apps. As they are widely used by individuals and companies to monetize, the main goal of this list is to share knowledge about how to implement it correctly and in an optimized way.
